///// New Message:
///// Upon arrival at Struven

Captain Picard,

78 hours ago, a 22 year-old Kruger female was reported dead in her dorm room by her roommate, a 22 year-old Arthurian female. 
4 hours ago Struvian police indicted the roommate on charges of murder. 
The roommate is claiming she is the victim of forced treatment and false testimony.

Your mission is to take your crew down to the capital on Struven IV and investigate the details of the crime and the case against the Arthurian girl. 

With all respects Captain, since this is your first diplomatic mission,  please allow me to suggest your team assignment:
	medical officer (Betty) - A medical officer is the best choice for investigating a murder scene.
	cultural specialist (Cindy) - The specialist can provide advice based on knowledge of local legal customs.
	head empat (Trin) - An empat is essential for discerning truth. 

Finally, we have sent information on the victim and the suspect to your ship. Before leaving for the planet, please check your information bank.
The Arthurian girl was born on Earth and is the daughter of a major Congressional delegate. 
You are to remain fair and respect all local customs, but securing freedom for the girl is a priority.

EOM

You have the option to select which crew members to bring with you (max of 3).
The interface changes to reflect beaming to the planet.
New commands are along the side.
Text in the middle reads:


////////////////////////////
//   Struven Capital
//   The cramped facades of its old-style dwellings charm tourists of all races.


Mary, a friendly Kruger employee of the state secretary's office, escorts you to the Arthurian consulate.

While deployed to a planet, you can order the crew members with you to perform certain tasks.
Only the correct combination(s) of crew, level, and task will produce new information.

Review the court files.
Cultural Specialist:
Captain, the case against Ms.Liebeck is not without its evidence against her.
The authorities say that on the night of the murder, both Ms.Liebeck and Ms.White had an exam. Prior to the exam, Ms.White told a study group that she felt too ill and she was going home. Ms.Liebeck was seen in the exam, but Ms.White never showed up.
However, there is video evidence from the dorm's back turbo-lift that shows Ms.Liebeck going up to her dorm room . Thirty minutes pass before she returns down. The timing of the elevator ride is after Ms.White had left the study group, but prior to the exam. The authorities are claiming that Ms.Liebeck stabbed Ms.White and then went to the exam.
School records show that a short while ago, Ms.White was found guilty of illegaly accessing Ms.Liebeck's files and distributing them to several of their friends. The authorities are using this as a motive for revenge.
Ms.Liebeck is denying all charges. She claims she was in the Library studying before the exam. At one point during interrogation, she signed a testimony that she did return home before the exam, but Ms.Liebeck is claiming that was essentially a forced confession given the stress she was in.
Captain, I have linked the turbolift video and data to the ship's processors. Our own analysis may help.
(addOperation(PROCESSORS, "TURBOLIFT DATA"))

Anyone else:
Sorry, Captain. I can barely understand Arthurian legal documents. Specialist (Cindy) should be able to help you.


Review crime scene reports.
Medical:
Captain, there is a clear sign of struggle prior to the murder. The victim is lying face forward in a puddle of her own blood. Dressed only in a nightgown, there are several stab wounds through her back. Her bed is completely disheveled with blood over all of the sheets. 
The autopsy reports say nothing about signs of sexual abuse, only evidence of a severe physical attack prior to the stabbing. She was stabbed five times, all in the back. 
The reports basically end there.
Captain, these reports are very sparse. I am sending the raw data to the ship. Hopefully our processors can find some more information for us.
(addCommand(PROCESSORS, "Autopsy Analysis."))
 
Anyone else:
I don't know, Captain, it looks pretty gruesome. She was stabbed in the back while in her nightgown. There's blood everywhere. I think the doctor could tell you more.


Visit the suspect.
Empat:
Captain, the suspect was very distraught. She was very glad to get to talk to me. She continually claimed she was innocent and complained that her treatment so far has been very harsh, almost torture. She said they have kept her in solitary confinement for most of her arrest and that for over 48 hours before she signed the false confession they used loud noises to keep her awake.
Her story is that she was at the library all day studying before the exam. She went directly from the library to the exam, took the exam, then went out with friends. When she got home, she discovered Ms.White's body and immediately called the local authorities.
I have no reason to doubt her testimony, Captain. All readings point towards truth and I can personally vouch that she shows signs of harsh treatment.
I cannot read the library's access records directly, but I have linked them to our ship databanks. They should indicate when and for how long Ms.Liebeck was at the library.
(addCommand(DATABANKS, "Library Access Records."))

Anyone else:
She is in an awful state, Captain. She says she is innocent and was at the library all day before the exam. She says they are practically torturing her and forced her to sign a confession.
I don't know, Captain, maybe the Empat can help.


Interview the friends.
Empat: 
Captain, the friends who were out with the suspect agree that she seemed distant after the exam. They say she stayed out late drinking with them and then went home. They remember her checking her communicator often, but no one ever messaged her.
Other residences of the dorm said that there was a boy usually in their room,  Hunter Hahs, a 24yo Aquarrii. He lives on nearby Groombridge VIII and visits almost every weekend.
I saw no attempt of subterfuge. Everything indicates they were telling the truth.
I hope you dont mind, Captain, but I checked Ms.Liebeck's communicator and there is a record of a voice exchange between her and Mr.Hahs. The record shows it took place right after the exam, but somehow no positional data or voice record is available.
(addQuest(GROOMBRIDGE, "Visit Hunter Hahs"))

Anyone else:
I asked around the dorms, Captain, but no one seemed like they wanted to talk to me. I did find out that Ms.Liebeck seemed strange after the exam, but that is all. Perhaps the Empat can do better.


Go back to the ship.

(On the way back, you are stopped at customs before boarding your ship. 
You are brought before an important-looking Kruger military officer.)

Processors.
Results of Process "Ema Liebank Autopsy Analysis":

Missing Data:
Body photos indicate stab wounds too high for someone of Ms.Liebank's height. 
There is no mention of this in the report.

Computer records show many uses of the room's DNA processor during the autopsy.
There is no mention of this in the report.

Inconsistencies:
Report attributes marks on victim's wrists and ankles to physical struggle.
Photo analysis of marks instead indicate use of polycarbon restraints.




Results of Process "Turbolift Data":

Time of elevator records: 
21800 UP
21824 DOWN

Missing Data:
Individual in video matches suspect in approximate height, weight, body type, clothing style, hair color and style, body movement, and body proportions. 
Individual's position in the video hides important from the camera such that insufficient facial data is available to attempt any facial match.

Inconsistency:
Turbolift weight records are consistent with what would be expected, but inconsistencies exists between the data write times and those registered in the audits. 
This usually indicates tampering.

After both analyses, it is concluded that there is a very strong chance that Ms.Liebeck did not stab Ms.White. 

A separate Processing job has begun to calculate the most likely suspect. It will finish by the time you have finished reading this report. 
It is recommended that the judge overseeing the case be notified of these results, immediately.
(addCommand(CULTURAL, "Take processor findings to Judge"))



Results of Process "Calculate Prime Suspect":
Nearby Rosh system has had many recent reports of sexual violence and murder, most occurring on young women. The main suspect is said to be a master of disguise, gaining access and eluding capture by imitating the victim's acquaintances. 
The details of the White murder match those reported on Rosh. The only clue so far in the murders is that litho-crystal dust particles have been found at every crime scene.
Ship sensors should be able to indicate the presence of litho-crystal in the dorm room.
(addCommand(SENSORS, "Search for litho-crystal dust."))


Sensors.
Search for litho-crystal dust.
Ship sensors are malfunctioning and unable to scan the room.
Hand-sensors would be able to detect the dust. It is highly recommended that chief information officer () conduct the scans.
(addCommand(INFO, "Scan dorm room for litho-crystal dust"))



Transport to Struvian Capital

Scan dorm room for litho-crystal dust.
Info chief:
Captian, hand sensors indicate a small presence of the dust.
Litho-crystal, however, is not rare and used in a variety of scientific research.

Anyone else:
Yes, Captain, the hand sensor is picking up the dust.




Take processor findings to Judge.
Cultural Chief:
Captain, the judge was very specific. He knows that the court has enough evidence to convict Ms.Liebeck. He rejected to hear anything contrary. 
This is very common in Kruger society. Their legal system has few loopholes and tends to force itself heavily on those that it can prove guilty. Kruger juries quickly and easily convict suspects when there's evidence against them.

Empat:
Captain, the judge did not like talking with me. He refused to listen to any new evidence. I could sense he was nervous. Perhaps it's because he's a Kruger, but there must be some heavy pressure on him from his superiors above.

Anyone else:
I waited for several hours outside of the judge's office, but he never arrived. I left the findings, but I doubt he will read them.





Groombridge: Visit Hunter Hahs
///////////////////////////
//// Groombridge System
Groombridge has 3 planets, all of them are uninhabitable, with a medium-sized starbase orbiting the first planet. The station is independent of any federation and is the location of a significant black market and its lawless inhabitants.


Communications: Captain, we have been refused dock access to the starbase. 

Commands: Hail : Groombridge I Starbase

Hail Recvd.
Starbase Dockmaster Crowley Replying
Captain, I apologize, but I cannot allow your ship to dock. It is bad for our business to allow access to government ships. 


We are here investigating a separate matter. We will not 



Security: Captain, the starbase of Groombridge is independent and does not respect any diplomatic authority. It is too dangerous and against regulations for you to visit, therefore to investigate on the starbase, I must insist that you send a shuttlecraft with an away team.
