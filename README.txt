Make it So v0.2

Make it So is a Node.js web application disguised as a game.

The back end uses Node.js with the Express plugin and stores its data using mongoDB. The front end uses jQuery for its AJAX, CSS transitions for its animation, and Twitter bootstrap for its responsive grid.

The code is 100% javascript.

You can't play it yet, but I am very very close to having a working POC demo.

This project is in a very early stage. My first priority has always been to get something working first and then further refine it when I need to. As such, you may some inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the code. I try to point these out in comments when I catch them.


Make it So is inspired by Star Trek: The Next Generation. As captain of a diplomatic ship of the Human Inter-Solar Diplomatic Corp, you navigate the galaxy solving mysteries and resolving diplomatic crises. Use your crew and ship instruments to gather data then your wits and captain's instincts to make the right calls and bring peace to the galaxy.
