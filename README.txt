Make it So v0.2

Make it So is a Node.js web application disguised as a game.

The back end uses Node.js with the Express plugin and stores its data using mongoDB. The front end uses jQuery for its AJAX, CSS transitions for its animation, and Twitter bootstrap for its responsive grid.

The code is 100% javascript.

So far only the user registration and basic interface is working. It's pretty but also pretty buggy. You can play it here: http://hi-scor.es:3000/start/

This project is in a very early stage. My first priority has always been to get something working first and then further refine it when I need to. As such, you may notice inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the code. 


Make it So is inspired by Star Trek: The Next Generation. As captain of a diplomatic ship of the Human Inter-Solar Diplomatic Corp, you navigate the galaxy solving mysteries and resolving diplomatic crises. Use your crew and ship instruments to gather data then your wits and captain's instincts to make the right calls and bring peace to the galaxy.
